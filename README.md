# XBG Project
The transformations of our planet and pollution are pushing the world population towards the need to convert the way of producing energy. Nowadays the need to create energy self-sufficiency circuits in their homes is becoming ever stronger. This is why our project is based.
Bitcoin Earth is the new currency of 2018 with which we want to create an online market for the purchase and sale of equipment for the use of renewable energy.
In our website there is already the "Green Shop" section that will be entrusted to a company that wants to deal with the sale of solar panels, domestic wind turbines and everything related to the tools of self-sufficiency domestic energy.
The only constraint that we will ask is to accept only XBG coin to buy the products, so that we can insert the currency in an economic circuit.

# XBG Token

Bitcoin Earth is an ERC20 token that will be developed on Ethereum's Blockchain.
It will be issued through an ICO (Initial Coin Offer) at a price of 140000 XBG / ETH with a minimum bid of 0.08 ETH (just over 11000 XBG). 
The total supply will be about XBG 1000000000, including those that will be released in the Bounty Program. 
ICO will start at the end of the countdown on our site. From that moment the ICO page will be available in the menu of the site where all the steps to participate will be explained.

# Bounty Program

In order to make our community grow, we offer the first 100 members of the telegram group, a Bounty Program.
In fact, the first 100 subscribers to the Telegram group, will be able to communicate their wallet address to be included in our "Reserved Token List" and will have a free 1000 XBG token at the end of the ICO.
